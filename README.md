# Task-2-titanic-dataset-analysis

🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis

This project explores the Titanic Dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival patterns, and key factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations using Python.

📌 Project Overview

In this notebook, we perform:

✔️ Data Loading

Load the Titanic dataset using Pandas

View initial rows and understand dataset structure

✔️ Data Exploration

Summary statistics (df.describe())

Checking data types

Identifying missing values

Understanding numerical & categorical features

✔️ Data Visualization

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we visualize:

Distribution of passenger ages

Passenger class vs. survival

Gender vs. survival

Heatmap of correlations

Histograms for numerical columns

Count plots for categorical columns

These visualizations help us understand which features played an important role in survival.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data loading & manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib – visualizations

Seaborn – advanced plotting
